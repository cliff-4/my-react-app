# README

Hi :)

This is my personal project to simply learn about web-development. I have used here techs like React (with TypeScript), Vite, Docker and Tailwind CSS.

Before this, I had really no idea about how one does web-development. So this is more or less a learning project for me, as evident by the repository title.

Anyway, here are a few screen-shots of the website. Hope you like it! :)
